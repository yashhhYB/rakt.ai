# 🩸 RAKT.AI – Your Smart Blood Donation Buddy

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to **RAKT.AI**, a web app that’s reimagining blood donation in India using AI, smart design, and a whole lot of heart. Whether you want to donate, request, or just track what’s going on – this app has your back. ❤️

---

## 🚀 What’s RAKT.AI All About?

We saw a big problem: low blood supply, lots of myths, and super outdated systems. So we built **RAKT.AI** to help solve it — with predictions, smart matching, logistics, gamified dashboards, and even drone delivery ideas. Inspired by how top countries do it, but made for Bharat 🇮🇳.

## 🔍 Cool Things You Can Do

### 🔮 Predict Shortages

See where blood might run out *before* it actually does. We use AI to map this out and alert hospitals or NGOs.

### 🧠 Get Personalized Donor Suggestions

You’ll get suggestions on when and where to donate – all based on your health, location, and blood bank needs nearby.

### 🩸 Check If You’re Eligible (The Smart Way)

Forget the boring old forms. We use a fun, smart, behavior-based quiz to check if you're ready to donate (inspired by Australia).

### 🏅 Earn Badges & Rewards

Gamified dashboard = instant good vibes. Track your donations, earn badges, and unlock cool perks like health checkups or metro passes.

### 🚚 Track Blood on the Move

Ever wondered where your blood goes? With our live maps, see where it's being used. Oh, and we’re adding drones for rural delivery soon.

### 🤖 Ask Our Multilingual Chatbot

Got questions? Talk to our friendly AI chatbot — it busts myths, gives donation tips, and chats in Hindi, Marathi, Tamil, and more.

### 🧾 Walk-in Kiosk Mode

Perfect for camps or malls. Just scan, fill your form on a tablet, and get your donor QR instantly.

### 👥 Be Part of the Walking Donor Bank

Get on a local list of ready-to-help donors. When someone nearby needs help, you’ll get the call.

### 📊 Admin Dashboard (for the Big Picture Folks)

Blood banks, NGOs, and hospitals can monitor everything from blood units to plasma and plan ahead with confidence.
